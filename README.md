# Heidelberg_Python_Lecture_2019

### Goal of this lecture:

The goal of this lecture is to have a starting point to develop code in Python for students at the master or PhD level that already had some sort of programming lecture in the past.

The lecture will be done in two steps:
 - First: go through the different files in the ./tutorial/ directory and try to 
 - Second: let's look at the ./projects/ directory.

### Python installation:

There are two major version of Python: 2.7 and 3.7. Python 2.x support will stop in 2020 https://pythonclock.org/ it is therefore advise to switch to Python 3.x series. Both are not compatible, but the differences are most of the time minimal.

The Python 3.x installation can be done from the anaconda website:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

On my mac it was completely straight forward to install it. If you encountered any difficulties let me know and we will take a look.

Once you have done this, take a look at the ./computer_setup/ directory.
