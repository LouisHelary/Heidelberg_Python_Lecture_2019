    "Python 2.7 was released on July 3rd 2010, and will not be supported anymore from January 2020. Python 3.7 was release on June 20th 2018 and will be supported in the future, which is the reason why we are using it.\n",

    "## 2) Why using Python?\n",
    "There are many reason to use this language:\n",
    "- It is cross-platform, and works on many OS, or hardware.\n",
    "- It is free.\n",
    "- It is a high level language, and do not necessitate a lot of knowledge on computers.\n",
    "- It is interpreted, it does not need to be compiled.\n",
    "- It is oriented object.\n",
    "- It is easy to start with.\n",
    "- It is the language currently used in the industry and academia for data analysis.\n",
